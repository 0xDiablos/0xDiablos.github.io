Yes, i got the offset So let's see it what will happen if i did `python -c "print 'A'*40" | ./ret2win32`

Yes we got it, Now we need to get address to jmp on it let's use `r2 ./ret2win32`

We got func called pwnme !!!  
Why not let's try to jump on it  
Let's do python script to automate this mission

Why did it `'A' * 44` because i try it 40 but it's doesn't work

And we did it
